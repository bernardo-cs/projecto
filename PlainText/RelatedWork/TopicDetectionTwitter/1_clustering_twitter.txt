## Politics Twitter and Information Discover

Cluster users based on issue framing

- Finds most influence twitters in a specific hashtag with non sparse contributions (more than 40 tweets on the topic). Measures their influence through third party API twitalyzer.
- Bundle all tweets from a single user into the document representation of a user-> transformed into bag of words
- Use VSM and measure the euclidean distance.
-Twitter Corpus Specific Analysis:
  - Calculate user rank by mentions in twitter using  SimRank.
  - Jaccard Similarity coefficient .

- Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering to cluster documents
  - Content based clustering
  - Hash tag based clustering 
  - Mentions based clustering -> shit!


## Tweet Mining using wikipedia and Impurity Cluster Management

Hashtag as a topic problems:
  - multiple hshtags same tweet
  - multiple hashtags same topic

Expand feature set with wikipedia to overcome tweet categorization problem due to the fact that tweets are extremely short.

Algorithm:
  - Tweet extraction with stop word/slang/unkown words removal, search wikipedia with the words that are left and get the first 3 to 7 results.
  - First cluster (K-NN) then classify clusters
  - Classify the clusters into topics with percentages where they can be strong or weak clusters
  - If a cluster is very weak they minimize its impurity by applying a Gini Coeficient 
  - They have awesome precision and recall results but don't explain how they evaluated the results (who verified if the tweets where well labeled??)

## Key word base Document Clustering
Instead of using TFIDF related methods for clustering, use word weights (keywords) -> Makes sense for twitter
