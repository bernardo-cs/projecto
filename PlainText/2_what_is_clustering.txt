 - What is Document clustering:
	- Optimal division of the cathegory without prior knowldge of the data gathered, based only on the similarity between documents -> Unsupervised Machine Learning
	- Clustering uses:
		- Preprocessing for NLP
		- Automatic Sumarization
		- User preference mining
		- Improve Text Classification results
	Clustering types:
		-Hard Clustering: one document belongs to one cluster
		-Soft Clustering: one document can belong to one or more clusters
	Clustering main framework:
		1º  text documents
		2º  Keyword Identification
		3º  Constructing Feature Space
		4º  Similarity Computation
		5º  Mapping Documents to Clusters
		6º  Document Clusters

	Representing text in mathematical expression:
		-VSM (suport vector machines):
				1º  Each dimension means one term which come from the key words of the document
				2º  Each document is presented as one vector in the feature space
				3º The document vector is usually a sparce vector due to the size of its dimension
					*Sparse vector is a vector with a lot of zeroes: pairs whith the value and position:
					- example :
						[1,0, 0,0 ,4 ]  --> [(0,1),(5,4)]

	Dimensional Reduction:
		- Due to huge  size of the  VSM , its dimension must be reduced:
			- PCA (principal component analysis):
				1º  given matrix n*m order document matrix
				2º  k eigenvectors (valor próprio) of the PCA with an m*m order covariance. 
				3º Reduces the dimension to k, which is smaller than m
			- LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing), similar to PCA but makes value decomposition on the initial m*n matriz instead of the m*m. The selects the eighten vectors
	
	Extract Important Features from documents:
		- Remove stop words will improve clustering 
		- Different wheights shoul be given depending on the location of the word in the document if the document is has some kind of formatation (like html headers, twitter hashtags, etc...)
		- Feature dectection is whole are of research by itself 

	Clustering startegies:
		- Complete strategie:  document collection does not change
		- Incremental : Document collection can increase. 
	
	Calculating the distance or similarity between clusters:
		1º Shortest distance method
		2º Longest distance method
		3º Group average method
		4º Centric Method
